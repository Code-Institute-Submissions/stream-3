Project can be viewed [here](https://bookah.herokuapp.com/).

The website is a platform for artists to promote their services for weddings among other events. Artists can create an account and upload images, social media links, info about themselves and contact details. At the moment the service is free but if enough interest is shown it may be upgraded to a subscription service. When writing the code for the project I had reusability and scalability  in mind I wrote each section to be packaged up and reused and integrated into another app seamlessly and so the website grow easily and new features be added. A lot of the logic and app structures I used I learnt from doing the diffrent modules in the course. 

## Frontend
### HTML
I tried to use as much semantic HTML5 as possible including nav, section, footer, figure, figcaption. I didn't want to stuff the site with it if it wasn't needed.

### CSS (SASS)
I used SASS for my CSS as I find it keeps a project's code nice and tidy and helps stop the stylesheets getting out of control. It can also make it easier for other developers to jump straight into a project and start work with minimal guidance.

### Javascript
There isnâ€™t a lot of javascript being used on the site. Mainly for the mobile navigation.

## Backend

### Framework
The backend framework being used for the site is Django. Django is a phyton web framework it makes it quick to build web apps. 

### Database
For my local build i used the Django default sqlite but once deployed I used clearDB.

### Deployment
I used Heroku to deploy and host my app.
